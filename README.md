##  <br /> <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Simple GSAP workshop showcasing various primary animations. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a framework-agnostic JavaScript animation library used to create fluid and engaging animations.


##  <br /> <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- [**React**](https://react.dev/reference/react) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes over time. React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components, making development more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain. 

- [**GSAP**](https://gsap.com/resources/) (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It excels in animating HTML elements with smoothness and precision, making it ideal for enhancing user interfaces and web experiences. GSAP's robust API allows developers to create complex animations easily, leveraging timelines and plugins for advanced control and customization. Its efficient rendering engine ensures animations run smoothly across different browsers and devices, providing a seamless user experience.

- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a modern frontend build tool known for fast ES Module imports, efficient bundling, and quick development server startup times. It supports frameworks like Vue.js and React, optimizing workflow and performance compared to traditional bundlers.

## 🧩 Usage & Examples

Here’s a minimal usage example (if applicable):

```html
<div id="cocktail-menu"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { initMenu } from './src/index.js';

  initMenu({
    container: document.getElementById('cocktail-menu'),
    drinks: [
      { name: 'Mojito', color: '#a8e6cf' },

    ]
  });
</script>
```

*(Adapt based on how your module/API is structured.)*

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

- **/constants**: define drink names, colors, animation durations  
- **/src**: core logic, animations, UI components  
- **CSS / styling**: override or extend themes & styles  
- **Vite config**: for path aliases, build tweaks  

Feel free to add new drinks or animation variations by editing the constants and hooking into the animation engine.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- Run linters & formatters:  
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format
  ```

- (Optional) Add unit tests or snapshot tests with your favorite test runner (e.g. Jest, Vitest).

---

## 🔁 CI / Deployment

If you set up GitHub Actions or similar CI, consider:

- Lint & test on PR  
- Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel  
- Version bump & release tagging  

Here’s a sample stub for `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```
